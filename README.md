# Lethal Anomalies

*"The Olympic Peninsula, the crown jewel of the Pacific Northwest! Its unmatched views and quiet solitude offer everything you need in the most beautiful place on Earth! Now coming directly onto your favorite moons!"*

**Lethal Anomalies** is a mod that aims to bring the anomalies from **Pacific Drive** into the game!
It currently adds **2** new outside enemies, but much more will come in the future.

### The Spark Tower

We believe those used to be plasma-powered radio transmitters, but rust and anomalous influences got to them and now they have a nasty habit of zapping everyone around them. At the very least it has the courtesy of charging up if you're entering the danger zone, so stay away if you hear it.

<details><summary>More info (SPOILERS)</summary>

When the tower senses players nearby, it will play an audio cue indicating that they are entering the danger zone. Staying within the detection radius for too long will trigger the tower to charge up, then release lightning that smites every player still within range, before entering a short cooldown phase. The more players are in the zone and the closer they are to the tower, the faster the attack will trigger!

As well as its spawn weight, you can configure the effective range of the tower (detection and attack combined), how fast it is to attack players when detecting them, and how long the cooldown lasts for.

### The Tourist

It is theorized the weird influences of the Zone have hit a crash test dummy production factory, allowing them to escape and roam around every single one of our operation sites. That wouldn't be so much of a problem if they didn't decide to mix in with highly volatile explosives making them explode whenever something touches it. To make matters worse, their curious nature makes them very interested in the scrap we're after, especially the shiny ones...

<details><summary>More info (SPOILERS)</summary>

The tourists are mildly dangerous entities that move when you do not look at them, and are attracted to both players and shiny scrap items (scrap mods compatibility will be added over time). As they make their way to their target, they can be distracted if you drop a shiny item on the ground. However, once they start stalking their target, which is indicated by a red light on their chests, they can no longer be distracted and will keep on following their target for ~30 seconds before getting bored and looking for a new target. Getting too close, shooting it, or making an enemy walk into a tourist will trigger it to explode, also triggering nearby tourists to create a chain reaction.

Tourists will never spontaneously explode behind a player's back, so avoiding to walk backwards will significantly reduce the odds of dying to them.
